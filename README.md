**Transform Your Fitness, Unleash Your Potential**

**📖 About This Project**

My first Android app built using Java, where I learned key Android development concepts like:

🧩 Activities, Intents, and Fragments

🏗 LinearLayouts and other UI components

⚙️ Gradle build system

🧠 Understanding how Android app structure works

This project tracks user steps and calculates calories burned — a simple but powerful start to my Android development journey.
